## SDLC Overview

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** typically includes:

1. **Requirement Gathering**  
   - Involved: Product Manager, Project Manager, Designer
2. **Design**  
   - High-Level Design (HLD), Low-Level Design (LLD)  
   - Involved: Software Engineer, Engineering Manager
3. **Development**  
   - Involved: SDE 1, SDE 2, Interns
4. **Testing**  
   - Involved: QA Engineers, SDETs
5. **Deployment**  
   - Involved: DevOps Engineer
6. **Maintenance**  
   - Involved: Senior Developers

## Microservices vs Monolith

---

### ✅ Structure

**Monolith**  
- Backend, Database Connection, Frontend, Authentication, Emails, Analytics — all in a single application.

**Microservices**  
- Each part like Frontend, Backend, Authentication, Notification, Analytics is a separate, independent service.

---

### 🚀 Development Speed

**Monolith**  
- Slower because everything is connected and changes take longer.

**Microservices**  
- Faster development; teams can work independently on different services.

---

### 📁 Code Repository

**Monolith**  
- Single codebase — tightly coupled.

**Microservices**  
- Multiple small codebases — each service has its own repository.

---

### 📈 Scalability

**Monolith**  
- Poor scalability; hard to scale individual parts.

**Microservices**  
- Highly scalable; each service can scale independently.

---

### 🚀 Deployment

**Monolith**  
- Risky; deploying one change can break the entire system.

**Microservices**  
- Safer; services can be deployed independently. (Version mismatch might be a problem.)

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack Flexibility

**Monolith**  
- Usually restricted to one tech stack for the entire app.

**Microservices**  
- Different services can use different tech stacks (e.g., Node.js for one, Python for another).

---

### 💰 Infrastructure Cost

**Monolith**  
- Lower cost — all services run together.

**Microservices**  
- Higher cost — needs multiple environments, containers, or servers.

---

### 🧠 Complexity (in Large Projects)

**Monolith**  
- Gets complex and messy as the app grows.

**Microservices**  
- Easier to manage complexity by splitting into smaller services.

---

### 🔒 Fault Isolation

**Monolith**  
- One small issue can crash the entire app.

**Microservices**  
- Only the failed service breaks — rest continue to work fine.

---

### 🧪 Testing

**Monolith**  
- Easier — test the whole application at once.

**Microservices**  
- Harder — each service needs to be tested individually and with integration tests.

---

### 🔧 Maintenance

**Monolith**  
- Difficult — making changes often needs touching many areas. Sometimes requires a full rewrite.

**Microservices**  
- Easier — change or update a single service without affecting others.

---

### 🐞 Debugging

**Monolith**  
- Easier — logs and flow are centralized.

**Microservices**  
- Harder — logs are spread across services; requires distributed tracing.

## Summary

- **Monolith**: Easier to start with, but becomes complex and less scalable with growth.
- **Microservices**: Great for scalability, speed, and flexibility but comes with operational complexity and cost.
